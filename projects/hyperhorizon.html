                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>HyperHorizon built an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) originally for defense applications. My job was to expand the market beyond defense to NGOs and marine research institutions, make the technology usable for non-technical operators, and secure government funding through competitions.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>What I Did</h2>

                    <h3>Figured out the market</h3>
                    <p>I researched 22 competitors to understand positioning. Then I talked to potential users in marine research and NGOs to validate product assumptions. The big insight: technical specs didn't matter if operators couldn't actually use the system. I also researched competitor HMI designs across different markets to document optimization recommendations for future product launches.</p>

                    <h3>Secured funding through competitions</h3>
                    <p>I prepared submissions for government tech competitions. This meant writing business cases, building pitch decks, and developing go-to-market roadmaps that balanced technical feasibility with practical deployment. We emphasized risk mitigation because that's what evaluators care about. Won 4 competitions, securing funding.</p>

                    <h3>Built the digital presence</h3>
                    <p>Launched HyperHorizon's LinkedIn, designed the website, and created marketing materials. Also maintained comprehensive documentation for the team.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>Working in a startup without a clear product manager meant I had to take initiative and own decisions I wasn't sure about. The CEO pushed me to execute when I hesitated, which helped me learn ownership the hard way. I struggled with it initially, but reflecting on what went wrong taught me how to take ownership properly—lessons I later applied more effectively as Alumni Affairs Secretary. Also learned that successful pitches are less about innovation and more about demonstrating you've thought through the risks.</p>
